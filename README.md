  <h1>Operational tools for Identifying Subpopulations and Evolutionary Significant Units to Support Conservation Management</em></h1>

  <p class="lead">
    This repository holds the access to a webtool and the guidance document to help users navigate a two-phase webtool to apply a framework for identifying subpopulations and Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) 
    in species based on different data types (genetic, recorded biological and inferred). This two-phase framework is intended to help identify appropriate units for biodiversity threat assessments 
    as employed by the IUCN (i.e., IUCN Red List and IUCN Green Status of Species) and other entities. 
    For more information, please look at the scientific paper accompanying this framework (https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/9129/).

  <h6>Figure 1 – Lines of evidence (A) and the Two-phase framework (B) to assess the strength of evidence for subpopulations and Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs). Different lines of evidence are highlighted in color (dark green, green and blue). Maximum scores are the numbers provided below each category in the boxes based on genetic or non-genetic evidence from the literature and other documentation. Below each phase the scoring system is explained by exemplary imaginary ‘scenarios’.</h6>

  <h2 id="contents">The webtool and how to access it</h2>
  <p>The webtool can be accessed through www.congenafrica.com/demo-survey/ and consist of several pages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Landing page</strong> which provides users with the most important aspects of the framework and tool.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 1</strong> to identify genetically meaningful subpopulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 1B</strong> to assess if the species is comprised out of one metapopulation.</li>
     <li><strong>Phase 2</strong> to identify Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs)s.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2B</strong> to assess if the species is comprised out of one ESU.</li>
  </ol>


  <h2 id="Step-by-Step Guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of this guide is to help users navigate a two-phase webtool to apply a framework for identifying subpopulations and Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) in species based on different data types (genetic, recorded biological and inferred; Figure 1A). It first explains the general features of the webtool and then presents two case studies to demonstrate how the tool can be applied.

    <li>
     The Step-by-step guide is available as PDF
      <a href="https://github.com/iucn-CGSG/Subpop-ESU-Webtool/blob/main/Step_by_Step_GUIDE_From_Framework_to_Practice.pdf">here</a>.

  <h2 id="Overview of the testing process">Overview of the testing process</h2>
   <p>Overview of the testing process/framework (Figure 1B)</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Species are assessed in so-called ‘candidate scenarios’.</li>
    <li>Within the framework three different lines of evidence (“genetic evidence”, “recorded-biological evidence” and “inferred evidence”) are used to accommodate different data availabilities for species (Figure 1A).</li>
    <li>Four different scenarios can be assessed simultaneously</li>
     <li>In Phase 1, genetically meaningful subpopulations are identified (Figure 1B).</li>
    <li>Candidate scenarios scoring ≥2 points qualify for Phase 2.</li>
        <li>In Phase 2, the subpopulations identified in Phase 1 may be tested individually or grouped into candidate ESU scenarios (Figure 1B). As with Phase 1, different lines of evidence are used to assess their ESU status.</li>
  </ol>
	   <p>Please note: Genetic or genomic data are required in Phase 2 to achieve a score of ≥10 and delineate genetically meaningful ESUs.</p>
